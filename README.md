# golangHelper
Assortment of golang helper functions

created as a helper class for Golang files and text.

These functions were needed for a project, but not readily available in 2019.

Feel free to use. Let me know if anything is not working correctly or it you want to contribute.

hide files, reveal files, make writable etc.

My favorites:

Chompr(text string) //similar to perl chomp

Shift (pToSlice *[]string) //similar to perl shift

Countdown(seconds int)
